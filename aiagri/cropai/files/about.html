            <p>   21st century is known as the age of Artificial Intelligence with AI technology developing for every field of science and commerce,there is<br>
                definitely a need to enhance the most basic and fundamental sector of human civilization, i.e. the agricultural sector.<br>
                India is an agricultural country hence there is much scope in using AI technology to improve quality of agricultural practices.<br></p>
            <img src="{% static 'aiagri.jpg' %}" alt="" style="float:left; margin:15px;" class="img">
            <p>In agriculture there is a quick adaptation to AI in its various farming techniques. The 	concept of  cognitive  computing  is  the  one  which imitates human thought process 	as a model in computer.
            This results as turbulent technology in  AI  powered  	agriculture,  rendering  its service in interpreting, acquiring and reacting to  different  	situations  (based  on the learning acquired)  to  enhance  efficiency.
                To  harvest 	benefits in the field by catching up with  the recent  advancements  in  farming  sector,  	the farmers can be offered solutions via platforms like chatter-bot.<br></p>
            <p>AI systems are also helping to improve harvest quality and accuracy what is known as 	precision agriculture. Precision agriculture uses AI technology to aid in detecting 	diseases in plants, pests, and poor plant nutrition on farms.
                AI sensors can detect and 	target weeds and then decide which herbicides to apply within the right buffer zone.
                This helps to prevent over application of herbicides and excessive toxins that find 	their way in our food.</p>

                Some Info About Group Project & Group<br>
                <p>Our problem statement was to Develop an AI to help farmers in choosing right yield using weather prediction .
                     According to our objectives We developed an A.I. using Time Series analysis to predict weather condition. Using ANN developing multi class classification for weather based crop prediction.
                    From data we collect we feed this data to that AI module & module will predict right crop yield for that field.
